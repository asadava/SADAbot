## --- WARNING ---

## The next horrible breakthrough in technology.
- A program I made inspired by SoulMachines, and my sister. She thought, "asadava, make a robot that cusses you out". I wanted to show my family this, so I made it clean, and here we are now, with this "thing".
## God is dead, and we can't bring him back.
- This robot insults you every 30 or so seconds. Basically an emulator of middle/high school hallways. Enjoy this thing I made.
## Why did you even make this thing?
- No comment.
## Why is there so many comments in your code?
- I made these to show to my friends and family, who don't understand Python
